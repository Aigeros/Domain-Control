Block unwanted content with a few clicks.

➤  It shows all requests of a website
➤  Disable bad domains with a click
➤  Speed up loading times
➤  Fight procrastination

Create your personal filter list with websites you want to block. 

Unlike some default list with over 10'000 entries, you are in control what is blocked and what not.

This will also result in higher performance because the block list will be way smaller.

Decide yourself what should be loaded, the click-menu shows domains to block. A click on the ✘-button disables the connection to the domain. 

But be careful to block not the wrong ones. Most websites need resources with terms like 'cdn', 'akamai', 'cloudflare' or 'static'.

Edit your filter list in the options dialog and set *. wildcards to block subdomains too.

Once added, just reload the website and they're gone.
