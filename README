# Domain Control
[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/domain-control/ceiohjbelbolibgeilkbblaednjngpje]

Block unwanted content with a few clicks.

Create your own, personal filter list with websites you want block.

➤  It lists all connection requests of a website – also ads and trackers
➤  Disable unwanted pop-ups, flashing banners or dangerous websites
➤  Speed-up your browser with faster loading times and fewer data usage
➤  Fight procrastination and free the web of social media buttons and more

Unlike some default list with over 10'000 entries, you are in control what is blocked and what not.

This will also result in a higher browser performance because the block list will be way smaller.

Decide yourself what should be loaded, the menu shows domains to block. A click on the ✘-button disables the connection to the domain.

But be careful to block not the wrong ones, most websites need resources with terms like 'cdn', 'akamai', 'cloudflare' or 'static' to function properly.

Edit your filter list in the options dialog and use wildcards (*.) to block subdomains, too.

Once added, reload your visited website and all filters will be active.
