Domain Control

Block unwanted content with a few clicks.

➤  It shows all requests of a website
➤  Disable bad domains with a click
➤  Speed up loading times
➤  Fight procrastination

Most websites are using 100+ http requests. That means a lot of data traffic - often from tracking companies, adservers, social media plugins and more.

Decide yourself what should be loaded and what not. Domain Control is able to block those unwanted sources.

The click-menu is used to show and control domains. A click on the ✘-button disables unwanted connections.

Edit your personal blocklist in the options dialog and set *. wildcards to block all kinds of subdomains too.

Once they are added, just reload the visited website and they're gone.
